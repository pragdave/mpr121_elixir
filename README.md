# MPR121 Interface for Elixir

  ** DON'T USE â€” Still under development **

  This module drives a MPR121 12-channel touch sensor via the I2C
  interface provided by Elixir/ALE.

  The interface sits on an i2c bus, and has an address that can be 
  set with a soldered jumper.

  You initialize the interface using `start_link()`, passing in the
  name of the bus (typically `i2c-1`. You can also pass the address of
  the MPR121 (which defaults to 0x5a) and options.

  ~~~ elixir
  { :ok, device } = Mpr121.start_link("i2c-1")
  
  bits = Mpr121.touch_state_all(device)  # => 12 bits, one per touch channel
  
  if Mpr121.is_touched?(device, 10) do
    # executes if pin 10 (numbered from zero) is currently touched
  end
  ~~~


  This module cannot run without the I2C module from Elixir/ALE.
  Unfortunately, ALE can only be built on Linux boxes. To partially
  mitigate this, we include a stubbed out version of the I2C module at
  the end of `lib/mpr121.ex`. This stub is only compiled into your
  application in `:dev` and `:test` environments. In `:prod` mix will
  automatically use the real thing. This means you'll need to set the
  env to :prod and do a `mix do deps.get, deps.compile` if you plan to
  run this on your development machine.

  If running with Nerves, this should all just work out.
